        Because you use more water to pull a lungo, the taste is much more subdued than that of an espresso or ristretto (a shot pulled with half the water). However, while the drink is less strong (due to the water) it is more bitter. For some, that may sound delightful. But for others the bitterness makes this version their least favorite of the espresso variants.
